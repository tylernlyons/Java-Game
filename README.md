## Part 1: App Description


 This app is a rendition of the classical arcade game
 Frogger. Users can utilize the WASD keys to move the frog
 to the five different goals to score points. Watch out for
 the cars and the running streams. 

 Ensure that you have graphics forwarding capabilities. Program can be ran with "./compile.sh" from the "frogger" directory.

## Part 2: New


 I learned a lot about the diversity of JavaFX and the realm of possibilities
 available through JavaFX. I also learned a lot about putting threads to sleep, setting
 delays, and threads in general.
